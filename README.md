Electric Vehicle Dataset EDA
==========================

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an electric vehicle dataset. The analysis provides insights into vehicle distribution, electric range, pricing, and market trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is a collection of electric vehicle data, including information on vehicle make, model, year, electric range, base MSRP, and more.

## Analysis
The analysis is performed using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code is well-documented and easy to follow.

## Key Findings
### Vehicle distribution: 
Tesla is the most common manufacturer in the dataset, followed by Nissan and Chevrolet.
### Electric range: 
There is significant variation in the electric range of vehicles, with some having very short ranges (close to 0) and others extending beyond 300 miles.
### Price (Base MSRP): 
The price distribution is highly right-skewed, with most vehicles clustered at lower price points and a long tail of more expensive vehicles.
### Model year:
The dataset primarily contains newer models, with a concentration around 2020.
### Vehicle types: 
The analysis shows a mix of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV), with BEVs generally having longer electric ranges.


## Code Structure
The code is organized into the following sections:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Univariate analysis

Bivariate analysis

Correlation analysis

Visualization


## Requirements
Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn
