Electric Vehicle Dataset EDA
==========================

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an electric vehicle dataset. The analysis provides insights into vehicle distribution, electric range, pricing, and market trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is a collection of electric vehicle data, including information on vehicle make, model, year, electric range, base MSRP, and more.

## Analysis
The analysis is performed using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code is well-documented and easy to follow.

## Key Findings

### Vehicle Distribution: 
Tesla, Nissan, and Chevrolet are the most common manufacturers in the dataset, indicating their dominance in the electric vehicle market.

### Electric Range: 
Most vehicles in the dataset have a shorter electric range, with a majority clustering between 0 to 50 miles. There is significant variation, but the distribution is right-skewed, with fewer vehicles having higher ranges.

### Price (Base MSRP): 
The price distribution is also right-skewed, with most vehicles at lower price points, indicating that electric vehicles are becoming more accessible to consumers.

### Model Year: 
The dataset primarily features newer models, especially those from around 2020, reflecting the recent growth and adoption of electric vehicles.

### Vehicle Types:
A mix of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) is present, with BEVs typically offering longer ranges.

### Correlations:
There is a positive correlation between Electric Range and Base MSRP, showing that vehicles with longer ranges tend to be more expensive. However, a negative correlation between Model Year and Base MSRP suggests that newer models are not necessarily more expensive, likely due to advancements in EV technology.


## Code Structure
The code is organized into the following sections:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Univariate analysis

Bivariate analysis

Correlation analysis

Visualization
